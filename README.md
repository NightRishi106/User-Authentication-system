🔐 User Authentication System
A beautiful, self-contained login and signup system that works entirely in your browser.

This is a frontend-only authentication system that lets users:
Create accounts with name, email, password, and role
Log in securely with their credentials
Stay logged in between browser sessions
View their profile in a personal dashboard
See all registered users in the system

🎯 Key Features
✅ Complete authentication flow (register → login → dashboard → logout)
✅ Password visibility toggle 👁️ (show/hide passwords)
✅ Beautiful glass-morphism design with forest background
✅ Responsive layout that works on all devices
✅ Session persistence - remembers logged-in users
✅ Real-time user list showing all registered accounts
✅ No backend required - everything works in your browser

🚀 How to Use
Open the HTML file in any web browser
Sign up for a new account using the registration form
Log in with your email and password
Access your dashboard to see your profile information
Log out when you're done
